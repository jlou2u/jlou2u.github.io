# ðŸ“š My Bookshelf

Books are the quiet companions of my intellectual journey, guiding, challenging, and inspiring me. Here, you'll find a curated collection of titles I've recently exploredâ€”each leaving its unique mark on my perspective and growth.

## Currently Reading (Audiobooks)

- *The Three-Body Problem, Cixin Liu* â€“ Already read but listening again with Suprina
- *Event, David L. Golemon* - almost done, kind of boring
- *Heat 2: A Novel, Michael Mann and Meg Gardiner* - fun so far
