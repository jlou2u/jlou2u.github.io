In a landscape where milliseconds matter and insights mean everything, I thrive at the cutting edge of innovation and precision. As an accomplished software engineer and systems expert, I am driven by one relentless ambition: to push the boundaries of what's possible, crafting solutions that are not only powerful and efficient but also elegant and intuitive.

My journey spans leading financial institutions and dynamic startups, where I've consistently translated complex ideas into powerful, resilient, and lightning-fast trading infrastructures. At Capital One, I engineer secure, high-performance systems with an unwavering commitment to data integrity and regulatory excellence. Previously, at Wagmo, I revitalized system performance by seamlessly migrating services from Python to Go, enhancing scalability and delivering solutions that accelerated growth.

In roles at Payward Inc. and PanAgora Asset Management, I mastered the art of blending languages and technologies—C++, Python, Go, and more—to develop sophisticated platforms capable of analyzing massive datasets and executing trades at unparalleled speed. At Man Numeric, I spearheaded transformative efforts, transitioning legacy research infrastructures into dynamic, Python-powered workflows, empowering traders and researchers alike with the tools for exceptional performance.

Throughout my career, I've balanced deep technical expertise with visionary leadership, mentoring teams, guiding projects, and consistently elevating performance standards. My technical toolkit is extensive and versatile, including Python, Go, C++, Java, Scala, Haskell, and JavaScript, alongside deep expertise in algorithmic trading, low-latency systems, cloud infrastructure, and quantitative analysis frameworks.

Beyond my professional pursuits, my foundational experiences—achieving Eagle Scout rank, leadership in the RPI Auto Shop, active participation in robotics, and outdoor adventures with the RPI Ski Club—highlight my commitment to integrity, teamwork, and continual growth.

If innovation is an art form, then consider me its dedicated maestro—relentlessly orchestrating elegant solutions, optimizing performance, and crafting resilient architectures that not only meet the demands of today but anticipate the challenges of tomorrow.

**Let’s build something extraordinary, together.**
